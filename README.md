# Learning Assembly Projects

## Next Projects

1. **Factorial**  
    Calculate the factorial of a number. This will be a great way to practice loops and recursion in assembly.

2. **Calculator**  
    Build a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. **FizzBuzz**  
    Implement the classic FizzBuzz problem to practice conditional logic and loops.

4. **Input Reverser**  
    Create a program that takes user input and reverses it, helping me understand string manipulation in assembly.
